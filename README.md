# Juliet Framework and CLI

## **Junctive Unstructured Learning for Incrementally Evolving Transformers**

Juliet is an experimental AI framework built for **incremental, evolutionary learning**. Juliet creates an ecosystem of lightweight isomorphic learners that grow, adapt, and evolve over time.

Each iso maintains its own **persistent memory** (via vector stores), **facts** and **todo lists** and ingests unstructured data from conversations, documents (`.pdf`, `.txt`, etc.), or other sources. Over time, isos will fine-tune **lightweight adapters** on their unique history, giving rise to divergent traits, behaviors, and emergent intelligence.

Juliet goes beyond conventional RAG pipelines. We are evolving a complex system where memory, state-space dynamics, and perturbations converge to produce creative and adaptive learning.
